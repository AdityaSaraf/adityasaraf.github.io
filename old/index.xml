title: Modelling Altruism in Kidney Exchanges
id: kidney
tagline: >
We conducted preliminary (theoretical) research on the effects of altruistic donors in kidney exchanges, which were modelled as dynamic matching markets. This work is especially relevant in light of schemes to encourage altruism, such as the National Kidney Registry's [voucher program](https://www.kidneyregistry.org/info/voucher-program).

title: Single Document Summarization
id: nlp
tagline: >
For my senior capstone, we compared neural and combinatorial approaches to *extractive* single document summarization, where sentences from the document are concatenated into a summary. Our neural approaches were constructed from recent literature, and our combinatorial approaches reduced to MaxSAT or ILP. We also built a web-based visualizer to compare the summaries generated by different models.
