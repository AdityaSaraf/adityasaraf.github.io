I am currently a Research Scientist in Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Washington, hosted by Anna Karlin. I recently completed my M.S. in Computer Science under Anna\u0026rsquo;s supervision.\nMy primary research interests lie in the intersection of economics and computer science. I enjoy creating compelling and realistic mathematical models of behavior, and rigorously investigating the outcomes of these models. My Master\u0026rsquo;s thesis formally modelled how agents might procrastinate when faced with a difficult task, and used competition to alleviate the harms of procrastination. I\u0026rsquo;ve also worked more broadly in theoretical computer science, investigating strong privacy definitions to protect correlated data and a unique, hidden property testing setting for graphs. In the past, I\u0026rsquo;ve done research in Tech Policy/HCI and Natural Language Processing.\nIn addition to my CS interests, I\u0026rsquo;m also interested in Epistemology and Philosophy of Statistics. I\u0026rsquo;ve investigated to what extent rational agents are obligated to form beliefs according to logical laws. I\u0026rsquo;m currently designing a new, social theory of statistical evidence that builds on likelihood-based methods, and is technically interesting because it\u0026rsquo;s compatible with weak, qualitative requirements on rationality.\n","date":1592524800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"term","lang":"en","lastmod":1592524800,"objectID":"2525497d367e79493fd32b198b28f040","permalink":"https://adityasaraf.github.io/author/aditya-saraf/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/author/aditya-saraf/","section":"authors","summary":"Hello and welcome to my portfolio.

In this model, an oracle hides the input and reveals some information about a violated constraint when given an unsatisfying assignment. For this paper, we consider an oracle that reveals the index of the lexicographically-first violated constraint. We model the problem of finding a certificate for a monotone graph property as a CSP and generalize this problem to certificate extension, the problem of extending a given subset of edges to a full certificate (a minimal subgraph with the property) if possible. We show a polynomial equivalence between certificate finding in graphs hidden by our \"Lex-first\" oracle and certificate extension in the unhidden context. We consider the complexity of \"Fixed Size\" certificate extensions, where the edge subset is of a limited size and show that certificate extension becomes harder with larger sizes. Finally, we use matroids to partially classify which monotone graph properties are extensible in polynomial time. These properties are easy in the hidden context, but our work in certificate extension is divorced from the hidden context and so may be of independent interest.\n","tags":["Theoretical CS"],"title":"Trial and Error for Graph Properties","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1527811200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1527811200,"objectID":"c8732b4904e915662baee9343daf407d","permalink":"https://adityasaraf.github.io/research/nlp/","publishdate":"2018-06-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/research/nlp/","section":"research","summary":"","tags":["other"],"title":"Single Document Summarization","type":"research"},{"authors":["Aditya Saraf"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1521417600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1521417600,"objectID":"d8142b3e4807218ce88734a61252c485","permalink":"https://adityasaraf.github.io/publication/logical_normativity/","publishdate":"2018-03-19T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/logical_normativity/","section":"publication","summary":"We argue that rational agents ought to seek out and believe the logical consequences of their existing beliefs.","tags":["Philosophy"],"title":"A Strong Bridge Principle for Logical Normativity","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1514764800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1514764800,"objectID":"6324711c9431b0bb47d099c9e0a12030","permalink":"https://adityasaraf.github.io/research/logical_norm/","publishdate":"2018-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/research/logical_norm/","section":"research","summary":"","tags":["phil"],"title":"A Strong Bridge Principle for Logical Normativity","type":"research"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1496275200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1496275200,"objectID":"b3e60ef2a72f8aa7ec56ca2937ad662b","permalink":"https://adityasaraf.github.io/research/tpl/","publishdate":"2017-06-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/research/tpl/","section":"research","summary":"","tags":["other"],"title":"Tech Policy","type":"research"},{"authors":["Emily McReynolds","Sarah Hubbard","Timothy Lau","Aditya Saraf","Maya Cakmak","Franziska Roesner"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1488326400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1488326400,"objectID":"2ffbf4c155d45b0ad97f815133e66a95","permalink":"https://adityasaraf.github.io/publication/toys/","publishdate":"2017-03-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/toys/","section":"publication","summary":"Hello Barbie, CogniToys Dino, and Amazon Echo are part of a new wave of connected toys and gadgets for the home that listen. Unlike the smartphone, these devices are always on, blending into the background until needed. We conducted interviews with parent-child pairs in which they interacted with Hello Barbie and CogniToys Dino, shedding light on children’s expectations of the toys’ “intelligence” and parents’ privacy concerns and expectations for parental controls. We find that children were often unaware that others might be able to hear what was said to the toy, and that some parents draw connections between the toys and similar tools not intended as toys (e.g., Siri, Alexa) with which their children already interact. Our findings illuminate people’s mental models and experiences with these emerging technologies and will help inform the future designs of interactive, connected toys and gadgets. We conclude with recommendations for designers and policy makers.","tags":["Other"],"title":"Toys that Listen","type":"publication"}]
