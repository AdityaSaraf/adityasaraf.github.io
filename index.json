[{"authors":["admin"],"categories":null,"content":"Hello and welcome to my portfolio. I am currently a first year PhD student in Computer Science at Cornell University, where I am working with Joe Halpern. I recently completed my M.S. in Computer Science at the University of Washington under Anna Karlin\u0026rsquo;s supervision.\nMy primary research interests lie in the intersection of economics and computer science. I enjoy creating compelling and realistic mathematical models of behavior, and rigorously investigating the outcomes of these models. My Master\u0026rsquo;s thesis considered a model of how agents might procrastinate when faced with a difficult task, and used competition to alleviate the harms of procrastination. I\u0026rsquo;ve also worked more broadly in theoretical computer science, investigating strong privacy definitions to protect correlated data and coordination games on large social networks. In the past, I\u0026rsquo;ve done research in Tech Policy/HCI and Natural Language Processing.\nIn addition to my CS interests, I\u0026rsquo;m also interested in Epistemology and Philosophy of Statistics. I\u0026rsquo;ve investigated to what extent rational agents are obligated to form beliefs according to logical laws. I\u0026rsquo;m currently designing a new, social theory of statistical evidence that builds on likelihood-based methods, and is mathematically interesting because it\u0026rsquo;s compatible with weak, qualitative requirements on rationality.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"term","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"2525497d367e79493fd32b198b28f040","permalink":"https://adityasaraf.github.io/author/aditya-saraf/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/author/aditya-saraf/","section":"authors","summary":"Hello and welcome to my portfolio.
